## Background ##

Last month I came across a DEV article titled ["I'm starting 30 days of commits in July, who'd like to join me?" ](https://dev.to/antjanus/i-m-starting-30-days-of-commits-in-july-who-d-like-to-join-me-n5o)  in which there is a community wide challenge to make at least 1 commit on a side project throughout the whole month. 

Unfortunately, I was returning from a trip to World Pride 2019 in New York City this Monday so I am already 1 commit behind, but it is my intention to start today, July 2nd, and make at least one small commit a day.

## The Project

My idea is to create an application, potentially desktop and web app compatible. The application will be a simple budgeting app. Currently, I budget simply through my Google Notes app on my phone, I keep track of the following things:

1. Each item I buy and it's cost
2. The running total of money spent each week on individual items
3. A separate list with each bill I owe
4. I mark off each time a bill is payed 
5. The total amount of money in my checking account

I hope to incorporate some, if not all of these functions into my project.

## Tools ##

What am I going to build this project with?

So far I know I want to use the software "Electron" which is used to design UI's for this project. This software is new to me so it will be a learning curve, but I have had interest in this tool for a long time and want to learn to use it.

Language is currently undecided. Perhaps Python for ease.
